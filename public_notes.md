#### Steps to become a pilot
Becoming a pilot is simple.  All it takes is 4 easy steps.  Follow these steps and work with the team at Blue Skies and you'll be a pilot in no time!

Step 1. Take a discovery flight
Every pilot starts their journey with a discovery flight.  A discovery flight is your first flight lesson where you'll have the chance to fly an airplane and see if you like it or not.  We can confidently say that most people who do a discovery don't only like it.. they love it. 

During your discovery flight, you'll be paired with one of our experienced instructors who will guide you through the basics of piloting. You'll take the controls, feel the aircraft respond to your commands, and experience the joy of flight firsthand. It's not just an introduction to aviation.  It's a preview of the incredible journey that you're about to embark on.

Step 2. Pair up with a CFI
After you complete your discovery flight and find out how much fun flying is, it's time to get to work.  You'll pair up with a Blue Skies CFI (certified flight instructor) who'll be your coach, friend, and mentor.  Your CFI will work with you one on one to understand your aviation goals, and then come up with a plan to achieve those goals in a timely fashion.
