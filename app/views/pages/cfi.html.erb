        <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-700">Many pilots on their way to the airlines or other careers in aviation spend a few years instructing to gain experience and flight hours.  Some pilots enjoy flight instructing and choose to make it a long term career.</p>

          <p>While being a CFI is the most common route for commercial pilots to gain enough flight experience to qualify for ATP minimums, it is not the best route for everyone.  CFIs have a direct impact in the future of aspiring pilots and if a CFI is not passionate about aviation and teaching, it can be detrimental in the experience of aspiring pilots.</p>
          <p class="pt-10">At Blue Skies Above, we take great pride in offering the best pilot instruction and education.  Future CFIs that are trained at Blue Skies Above will embody excellence and professionalism.</p>
