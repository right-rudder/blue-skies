        Your Discovery Flight is designed to give you a taste of what it's like to be a pilot. You'll spend approximately two hours with one of our certified flight instructors, who will guide you through the basics of flying and answer any questions you may have. You'll also have the opportunity to take the controls and experience the thrill of flying first-hand.
